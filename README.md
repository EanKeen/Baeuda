# Baeuda

Baeuda (배우다) - Korean for "learn"

Create, edit, and study flashcards offline using Baeuda. Baeuda will be a free desktop program available to everyone to use. Currently, there are no releases because the application is in early development. The following are features that will define future releases/versions.

## Features
### Version 1 Features
* Have a clean, responsive, and beautiful user interface
* Have at least four beautiful themes to choose from
* Suggest certain flashcards to study based on algorithm
* Import all flashcards and folders from a particular user on Quizlet (update automatically when there is no internet)
* Be able to categorize individual flashcards in sets, categorize individual sets in folders, and categorize individual folders in groups
* Navigate between sets, folders, and groups with ease
* Rename and move/remove/add sets/folders/groups with ease
* Preview sets/folders/groups in the form of flashcards and learn (typing in term/definition)
* Add a hint to the flashcard (from term to definition and from definition to term)
* Add tags to flashcards/sets/folders/groups
* Search in all flashcards/sets/folders/groups, or for a tag
* Create an unsorted folder so users automatically know when a flashcard set is not assigned to a folder
* See the statistics from a particular set/group/folder
* Sort statistics from least to greatest on alphabet/numerical value similar to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table#Section_link_or_map_link_to_a_row_anchor)
* Star a flashcard term for review later
* See categorial statistics such as "studied today" or "starred for review" from a particular set/group/folder

### Version 2 Release
* Export all saved flashcards
* Create a set/folder/group from a numerical statistic (dynamic or static)
* Create a set/folder/group from a specific query (dynamic or static)
* View all the (cumulative) statistics for the results of a search query
* Sort all of the created sets/folders/groups by alphabet/recently studied/creation date/custom. Additionally, view all of the sets with their parent folders, or by themselves. Also, view all of the folders with their parent group, or by themselves.
* Add photographs to a flashcard
* Add an icon to a set/folder/group that shows if the set changes dynamically (with statistic or search query), is static, an imported Quizlet set/folder, or a user-created set/folder/group
* Change the statistic/search query for folders/groups that change dynamically (as opposed to deleting them and creating a new folder/group based on a statistic/search query
* Add matching and other study techniques for sets/groups/folders
* Duplicate a set/folder/group
* Star a flashcard term with multiple colors
* Create a static or dynamic set/folder/group based on a categorical statistic

### Version 3 Release
* Sort all of the created sets/folders/groups by a custom numerical statistic (that can be applied to all of the sets/folders/groups)
* Create a flashcard drawing based on mouse movements
* Hover over a particular statistic to see a small graph of how that search query changed over time (this can be disabled in the settings panel)
* Click on a particular statistic to show how the statistic has changed over time (larger graph, and can modify graph parameters)

## Other Information
This will be a desktop application build using Electron. I have a half a year of Java programming experience and zero experience with CSS/JS, so let me know if something about this repository is wrong/irregular and needs to be fixed. Thanks!
